# C--Program-to-Encrypt-and-Decrypt-a-File
C++ Program to Encrypt and Decrypt a File.In this article, you will learn and get code on file encryption and decryption. That is, code to encrypt the data (content) of a textual file. And another code to decrypt the same data of a textual file.
What an Encryption and Decryption Means ?
Encryption of a data means converting the data from original form into a coded form. The coded form of original data can not be read by an unauthorized person.

Decryption of a data means, converting data from coded form to its original form.

Encrypted data can only be accessed by an authorized person.

Note - Authorized person knows the decryption key. Decryption key is a password or formula that is used to convert cyphertext to plaintext

Note - Encrypted data is known as cyphertext, whereas decrypted data (orignal data) is known as plaintext.

Therefore in simple language, converting data from plaintext to cyphertext is known as data encryption. Whereas converting data from cyphertext to plaintext is known as data decryption.
